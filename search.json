Entering multiple dates produce raster stack. product_ids \"VNP46A1\" \"VNP46A2\", date (eg, \"2021-10-03\"). product_id \"VNP46A3\", date year-month (e.g., \"2021-10-01\", day ignored, \"2021-10\"). product_id \"VNP46A4\", year date  (e.g., \"2021-10-01\", month day ignored, 2021). bearer NASA bearer token. instructions create token, see . variable Variable used create raster (default: NULL). NULL, uses following default variables: product_id :VNP46A1\", uses DNB_At_Sensor_Radiance_500m. product_id \"VNP46A2\", uses Gap_Filled_DNB_BRDF-Corrected_NTL. product_ids \"VNP46A3\" \"VNP46A4\", uses NearNadir_Composite_Snow_Free. information variable choices, see ; VNP46A1, see Table 3; VNP46A2 see Table 6; VNP46A3 VNP46A4, see Table 9. check_all_tiles_exist Check whether Black Marble nighttime light tiles exist region interest. Sometimes tiles available, full region interest may covered. TRUE, skips cases tiles available. (Default: TRUE). interpol_na data one date downloaded, whether interpolate NA values rasters using raster::approxNA function. Additional arguments raster::approxNA function can also passed bm_extract (eg, method, rule, f, ties, z, NA_rule). (Default: FALSE). output_location_type produce output; either memory file. memory, functions returns dataframe R. file, function exports .csv file returns NULL. file_dir (output_location_type = file). directory data exported (default: NULL, working directory used) file_prefix (output_location_type = file). Prefix add file saved. file saved following: [file_prefix][product_id]_t[date].csv file_skip_if_exists (output_location_type = file). Whether function first check wither file already exists, skip downloading extracting data data date file already exists (default: TRUE). quiet Suppress output show downloading progress messages. (Default: FALSE). ... Additional arguments raster::approxNA, interpol_na = TRUE aggregation_fun Function used aggregate nighttime lights data polygons; values passed fun argument exactextractr::exact_extract (Default: mean). add_n_pixels Whether add variable indicating number nighttime light pixels used compute nighttime lights statistics (eg, number pixels used compute average nighttime lights). TRUE, adds three values: n_non_na_pixels (number non-NA pixels used computing nighttime light statistics); n_pixels (total number pixels); prop_non_na_pixels proportion two. (Default: TRUE). quality_flag_rm Quality flag values use set values NA. pixel quality flag value, low quality values can removed. Values set NA value ther quality_flag_rm vector. (Default: NULL).
