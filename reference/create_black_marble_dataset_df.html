    <p>This function generates a data frame with filenames of Black Marble datasets. It allows filtering
by year, month, and day based on the provided parameters. Depending on the <code>product_id</code>, it generates
filenames for daily, monthly, or yearly data. The generated filenames are based on the specified product ID,
year, and day or month. The resulting data frame includes columns for the year and day or month, depending on the
type of data.</p>
